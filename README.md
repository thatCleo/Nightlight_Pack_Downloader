## DBD Nightlight Pack Manager for Linux
This is an electron based application for downloading and managing packs from [Nightlight.gg](https://nightlight.gg/) to customize some UI elements for Dead by Daylight.
It uses the Pack-page from Nightlight as a base to build upon, which means that it is always up to date with the packs uploaded there.
